# Semantic technologies team at ZB MED

_Combining semantic technologies and data analytics_

We are a multidisciplinary Research and Development team combining semantic technologies and data analytics. We work on the development of softare components and services to support and improve research on information retrieval, data science and literature-based knowledge discovery with a particular focus on reproducibility. Our areas of application include the evaluation of experimental retrieval and recommendation systems, practical support to FAIR+R principles for software and data science, and data analytics from the combination of ontologies and literature-extracted data in the Life Sciences domain.

The Semantic Technologies team is part of the [Knowledge Management group](https://www.zbmed.de/en/research/research-at-zb-med/research-knowledge-management/) at [ZB MED Information Centre for Life Sciences](https://www.zbmed.de/en).

## Current projects

### NFDI4DataScience

We are one of the participant groups in the [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.zbmed.de/en/research/current-projects/nfdi4datascience/) effort coordinated by Fraunhofer FOKUS. NFDI4DataScience aims to establish a community-driven research data infrastructure for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this regard, it focuses on several types of data and artifacts established within the community, including publications, data, models and code. Transparency, reproducibility and fairness have become crucial challenges.

### STELLA

[STELLA](https://stella-project.org/) aims to create an evaluation infrastructure that allows to evaluate search and recommendation services within productive web-based search systems with real users. STELLA project is a project funded by DFG and develop in collaboration with THK and GESIS. 

### OntoClue

[OntoClue](https://zbmed-semtec.github.io/ontoclue/)  is a research project aiming at finding and assigning topics to scholarly publications. It relies on background knowledge provided by ontologies and uses technologies such as graph embeddings, ontology hierarchical partition and name entity recognition.

## Working with us 

### Student assitant opportunities

* Further developments of the German translation of MeSH
* Controlloed vocabularies (e.g., ontologies) alignment for diseases
* Web interface for patron-driven data acquisition
* Tailoring CKAN (or similar) for reserach objects management
* Use of automatic translation tools (e.g. deepL) for diagnosis
* Use of semantic annotations (i.e., terms extracted from a controlled vocabulary and identified in scientific articles) for cluster-based document-to-document recommendations
