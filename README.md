_Combining semantic technologies and data analytics_

We are a multidisciplinary Research and Development team combining semantic technologies and data analytics. We work on the development of softare components and services to support and improve research on information retrieval, data science and literature-based knowledge discovery with a particular focus on reproducibility. Our areas of application include the evaluation of experimental retrieval and recommendation systems, practical support to FAIR+R principles for software and data science, and data analytics from the combination of ontologies and literature-extracted data in the Life Sciences domain.

The Semantic Technologies team is part of the [Knowledge Management group](https://www.zbmed.de/en/research/research-at-zb-med/research-knowledge-management/) at [ZB MED Information Centre for Life Sciences](https://www.zbmed.de/en).
